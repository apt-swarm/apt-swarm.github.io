The update steps are alot easier then getting in the repos!
<Steps>
    1. First, move any changes to the packaging repo, this is the repo on the apt-swarm org. This must include a version bump to the packaging.
    2. Create a new tag in the repo with the version name, then wait for our action to do its magic.
