This is for new package, updates are on the next page!

<Steps>
    1. Make sure your package meets all prerequisites on the [previous page](/uploading/prereqs).
    2. Create a new (public) repository on Github, or use a branch on your projects repository. Then please:
        - Update your new branch to allow for builds of `.deb` packages.
        - Create a script called `build.sh`, this script should build the app and place the `.deb` file into the `../built` directory. Some example scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/apt-swarm/swarmfm-player/blob/public/build.sh) and [here](https://github.com/apt-swarm/A-neuro-who-can-t-sing/blob/main/build.sh).
    3. [Create a fork of the repo](https://github.com/apt-swarm/repo/fork), and locate the `repos.json` file.
        <FileTree>
        - .github
        - **repos.json**
        - .gitignore
        - PROCEDURES.md
        - README.md
        - apt-swarm-public-key.asc
        </FileTree>
    4. Inside `repos.json`, add a new line.
        ```json
        {
            // other repos
            "package-name": "apt-swarm/package-name"
        }
        ```
    5. Make a PR with this tool: [PR Creator](/pr-maker). Please make sure you hit the "New package template" button.
    6. Fill in our template, and wait for either questions or approval of the repo! It should be created shortly after.
