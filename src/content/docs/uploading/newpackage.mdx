This is for new package, updates are on the next page!

<Steps>
    1. Make sure your package meets all prerequisites on the [previous page](/uploading/prereqs).
    2. Build your package with correct metadata, it should have a name, icon, and author at the very least.
    3. [Create a fork of the repo](https://github.com/apt-swarm/repo/fork), and locate the `repos.json` file.
        <FileTree>
        - .github
        - repos.json
        - .gitignore
        - PROCEDURES.md
        - README.md
        - apt-swarm-public-key.asc
        </FileTree>
    4. Inside `repos.json`, add a new line.
        ```json
        {
            // other repos
            "package-name": "apt-swarm/package-name"
        }
        ```
    5. Make a PR with this tool: [PR Creator](/pr-maker). Please make sure you hit the "New package template" button.
    6. Fill in our template, and wait for either questions or approval of the repo! It should be created shortly after.
